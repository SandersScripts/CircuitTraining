				<h1>About Myself</h1>
				<img src="http://i.imgur.com/GSEA2vW.jpg" alt="my_face" align="center">
				<break>
				<div class="center-justified">
					I have been interested in robotics, engineering and computers since my earliest memories.
					I continue to be an avid Lego builder, and recently my work as a part of a Minecraft building team has been published in a book recommended by the Wall Street Journal.
					I am self-taught in a variety of computer languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, and HTML.
					I am an active member of the Millburn High School computer science and State ranked robotics clubs.
					I enjoy sharing my love of computers and electronics with others, and I hope to instill my passion for 
					skills that are ever increasing in demand in today's technologically oriented world.

				<h1>Availability</h1>
				<div class="center-justified">
					During August I am available most days, seven days a week. 
					I often do volunteer work in a local Assisted community a few hours a week alongside work in my family business, but I have flexibility with my schedule. 
					During the school year, I work around my robotics and computer club, as well as fencing team, schedules.
				</div>
				<div class="center-justified">
					Initially, I meet with you and/or your child in person or Skype so you can get to know me and I can learn more about your son or daughter's abilities and interest.
					There is no charge for the 10-15 minute consultation.
					My hourly rate is $15 and I generally find that kids have a hard time focusing beyond an hour, but I am willing, if time and interest allows, to conduct longer sessions.
				</div>
				<div class="center-justified">
					I exclusively service the Millburn, Short Hills and Maplewood New Jersey communities.
