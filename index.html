				<h1>What I Can Do For You</h1>
				<break>
				<div class="center-justified">
					Is your child interested in computers or you would like to introduce coding concepts to your son or daughter? 
					Is camp over and now you want your children to have fun while learning valuable skills? Don't know where to begin?
				</div><br><div class="center-justified">
					<strong>I'm here to help</strong>! 
					As an honors student in Accelerated Robotics and AP Computer Science student (as well as a published Minecraft designer), 
					I can teach children ages 5-12 a variety of introductory and challenging computer and electronics skills. 
				</div><br><div class="center-justified">
					I can help your child learn the fundamentals and have a solid grasp of computer science in a variety of fun and engaging ways. 
					One popular method is using the game <i>Minecraft</i> to create an interactive space to explore circuits and logic gates using the "Redstone" functionality.
				</div><br><div class="center-justified">
					My proficiencies include:
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						-MIT's Scratch Creative Computing
					</li>
					<li>
						-Minecraft Redstone
					</li>
					<li>
						-Gamemaker
					</li>
					<li>
						-Basic HTML, Java, Python, etc
					</li>
					<li>
						-Basic Circuitry
					</li>
					<li>
						-<i>More advanced subjects available upon request</i>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<div class="center-justified">
					I charge $20 for one hour sessions. 
					I offer a free 30 minute consultation to meet with you and/or your child in person or via Skype so you can get to know me and I can learn more about your son or daughter's abilities and interests. 
					I find children generally lose focus after one hour, but longer sessions can be arranged if time, and especially interest, allows.
